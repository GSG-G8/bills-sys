### Team Members:

- Ahmad Safi
- Mohammed Irheem
- Rehab Al-Shawaf

### Problem:

It is hard for anyone to track and manage their bills. Also, we don't know if our consumption is over normal or not.

### Solution:

we want to create a website to manage and track your bills and show you a comparison between your bills with other people's bills who are from the same category. Also, we will show you some tips to reduce your consumption when you are over normal.

   - Along side with pgcli
   - [instructions on how to install pgcli](https://www.pgcli.com/install)

2. Open your terminal, run pgcli, navigate through the project to this path: `./server/src/config/createdb.sql`

3. Copy this file path and write in the terminal:

```
    \i <paste your copied path to the file>
```

4. build the dummy data by using this command:

```
    npm run build:db
```

### Project setup

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root folder.
2. Add the following in it **This step is so important!!**

```
    DATABASE_URL= postgres://billssys:123@localhost:5432/billssys

    DATABASE_TEST_URL=postgres://billssys:123@localhost:5432/billssys

    SECRET_KEY = ABCDE12345
```

3. To install the dependencies, run this command only for the first time:

```
    npm i
```

### Running the project:

```
    npm run server
```

2. To run the React Development server, Open another terminal and run:

```
    npm run client
```

3. To run the tests:

```
